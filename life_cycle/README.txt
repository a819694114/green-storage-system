Because the data is too large, pleave download from the link:
https://data.matr.io/1/projects/5c48dd2bc625d700019f3204
to recreate the models. 
After downloading the batches, run process.ipynb to process the data. 
Run "Data Training.ipynb" to train the modelsï¼Œand df.csv is created in the process to enable easier training in the future. 

training.ipynb needs to be run in AWS Sagemaker. 

learn.py is the script to run the training pipeline.
